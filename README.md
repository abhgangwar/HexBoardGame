About Game:
Hex is a strategy game played on hexagonal grids.
Each player has an allocated color, Red and Blue or White and Black[1] being conventional.
Players take turns placing a stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board.
The goal for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the opposing sides of the board marked by their colors, before their opponent connects his or her sides in a similar fashion.
The first player to complete his or her connection wins the game.
The four corner hexagons each belong to both adjacent sides.
Since the first player to move in Hex has a distinct advantage, the pie rule is generally implemented for fairness.
This rule allows the second player to choose whether to switch positions with the first player after the first player makes the first move.
